<h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong>Beef steak</strong>, or bistek, is an easy-to-make staple of the Filipino kitchen.
Basically it is beef well done with sauted onions and garlic. This dish originated with 
the Spanish after their first contact with the Philippine islands. Cows are not endemic
to the islands, but thankfully they were brought here and now we can enjoy a nice steak,
Filipino style!</p>
