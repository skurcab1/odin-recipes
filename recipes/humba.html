<h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong>Humba</strong> is a Filipino dish that originally
    came from the islands' contact with Chinese traders. 
    This delicious dish consists of tender pork, black beans, 
    and spices. Some versions of humba also contain banana 
    chunks, which is my personal favorite.

  If you travel to the Philippines and are invited to a party,
  wedding, birthday, or any other type of get-together, you 
  can be sure you will find humba on the serving table. If you
