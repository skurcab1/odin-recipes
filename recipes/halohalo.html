<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If you're in the mood to try a Filipino desert, the halo halo is a must. The name is Tagalog
    for "mixed," and that is exactly what the halo halo is: a mixture of various sweet things.
    Inside a halo halo you will find ice cream, coconut, banana, bits of flan, beans (?!) and everything else
    delectable and cavity-inducing.
</p>
<p>No matter where you go in the Philippines, no matter what restaurant, from Jollibee to 
    a street vendor, you'll find the national favorite, the halo halo. Visitors to the Philippines
    may initially be taken aback at such a creative mixing of various (seemingly random) ingredients,
    but once you try one, you'll be sure to understand the genius of this dessert.
